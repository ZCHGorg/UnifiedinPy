To avoid float problems, higher and lower order scaling runs best in Base4096 or higher.  Scripts are more or less chronological.

e.g. in CMD/Terminal:
python 1.py

dependencies are based on imports and should all be loadable using PIP e.g.
PIP install base4096
or
python -m pip install base4096

Python is assumed installed as a dependency.  You may wish to utilize a virtual environment if you're like me and have trouble with paths and global settings:
python -m venv venv
