This is to supplement the work over here - https://zchg.org/t/sacred-geometry-expressions-day-two/591/5

It is a unified framework which seems to cover a lot of bases.  Over there with that link are also some Matlab scripts as relate and of course the equations themselves which are part and parcel to a greater set of documentation hovering around https://zchg.org missions.

# UnifiedinPy
To avoid float problems, higher and lower order scaling runs best in Base4096 or higher.  Scripts are more or less chronological, though 8 is my current fav before more development.

e.g. in CMD/Terminal:

python 1.py

dependencies are based on imports and should all be loadable using PIP e.g.

PIP install base4096
or
python -m pip install base4096

Python is assumed installed as a dependency.  You may wish to utilize a virtual environment if you're like me and have trouble with paths and global settings:

python -m venv venv
